# 🐍 Snack Game

A fun, browser-based snake game built with HTML5 Canvas, styled for a retro arcade feel. Guide your snake to eat food, grow in length, and rack up points—while avoiding walls and self-collision!

---

## 🎮 How to Play

- Use **arrow keys** to navigate the snake (up, down, left, right).  
- Eat red squares (food) to **increase your score and grow**.  
- Game ends if your snake hits the **wall or its own body**.  
- Click **Reset 🐍** to start a new game anytime.

## 🧩 Features

- **Responsive Canvas**: 400×400 grid with smooth 25px unit movement  
- **Score Display**: Bold, stylized counter using "Permanent Marker" font  
- **Reset Button**: Custom-styled for quick restarts  
- **Collision Detection**: Game over when hitting walls or snake’s own body  
- **Classic Game Loop**: Built with `setTimeout` for smooth ticks every ~75ms

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Game Initialization**  
   Sets initial snake position, food placement, scoreboard, and starts the game loop.

2. **Game Loop (`nextTick`)**  
   - Clears screen  
   - Draws food  
   - Moves snake  
   - Captures input  
   - Checks for game over  
   - Repeats every 75ms

3. **Snake Movement & Growth**  
   - Snake moves by adding a head in the current direction  
   - If food is eaten, score increases and snake grows; otherwise tail is removed

4. **Food Generation**  
   - Randomly places food in multiples of the grid size (25px)  
   - Ensures valid coordinates within the canvas boundaries

5. **Collision Detection**  
   - Hitting the wall or colliding with itself stops the game and shows **GAME OVER**
